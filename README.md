# Magic-Coefficients
A collection of notes and achievements in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).


For someone who is curious about the origin of the repository's name, the reason that "magic-coefficients" was called is that AI and machine learning (ML) is a field all about building a model that can fit the actual condition. To achieve that goal, modifying the coefficients of the model is inevitable. When a good model is built, it means that a set of "magic coefficients" related to the model was found!

There are two parts in this repository, which are `notes` and `achievements`.

## Notes
This section contains notes of articles from journals or news about AI and ML.</br>
Original article will be attached to each note also.


## Achievements
This section will demonstrate the trained model to a specific problem from either [kaggle Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) or [HackerRank Artificial Intelligence](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/ai). The source code will also be enclosed.
